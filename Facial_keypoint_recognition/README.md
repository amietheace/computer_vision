This is an Implementation of Daniel Nouri tutorial for detecting facial keypoints of imageset. This was originally a kaggle competition and I have
implemented it using Keras and TensorFlow. The dataset was taken from the kaggle(directly downloaded) and then used google colaboratory to train
it using GPU.

In that first I have trained it using a simple neural network and after that usin CNN followed by Data augmentation step.
